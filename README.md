# Yo.
This repo is a template you can use to create a working Discord bot with a few simple moderation commands.
## Side note
You may have noticed that there's a reference in main.py to a .env file. Just change that out for your own bot's token or change the directory to another .env on your computer containing the bot token.
I'll add more details on a future commit, but for now, have fun.
